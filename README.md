## üì¶ Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The website automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: improve hero section animations"
git push origin main

# GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds (1-5 minutes)
```

### Manual Deployment Process

1. **Update content** in `index.html` (or relevant files)
2. **Test locally** to ensure everything works
3. **Validate** HTML and CSS using W3C validators
4. **Commit changes** with descriptive commit messages
5. **Push to main branch** - deployment happens automatically

### Custom Domain Configuration

If using a custom domain, ensure the `CNAME` file contains your domain:

```bash
echo "elevatedvector.com" > CNAME
```

### SSL/TLS

GitHub Pages automatically provides SSL certificates for custom domains. Allow 24-48 hours for initial certificate provisioning.
